/// It was considered to allow the DAO to adjust registration date to pay salary retrospectively,
/// but this seems giving too much rights to the DAO similarly as if it had the right to declare anyone dead.
///
/// It would cause this effect: A scientist who is already great may register then his date is moved back
/// in time and instantly he or she receives a very big sum of money to his account.
/// If it is done erroneously, there may be no way to move the registration date again forward in time,
/// because the tokens may be already withdrawn. And it cannot be done in a fully decentralized way because
/// it needs oracles. So errors are seem inevitable.
/// On the other hand, somebody malicious may create and register in my system a pool of Ethereum addresses that
/// individuals can receive from them as if they themselves registered in the past.
/// So it in some cases (if the registration date is past the contract deployment) this issue is impossible to
/// mitigate.
///
/// The salary is paid in minted tokens groups into "chains":
/// the original salary token and anyone can replace it by another token, next in the chain.
