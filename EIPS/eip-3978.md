## Abstract

 Since [EIP-3298](./eip-3298.md) gas refunds works for storage restores only inside the same transaction. For example [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) `approve` + `transferFrom` flow between 2 smart contracts according to [EIP-2200](./eip-2200.md) and [EIP-2929](./eip-2929.md) will cost nearly to `21600` gas with gas refund counter `20000`. But in case of reverting this subcall (containing both `approve` and `transferForm`) gas refund will be erased, while smart contract storage will remain unmodified. I think it should keep storage access costs, but still refund modification costs.

## Motivation

Ð¡urrent full cancelling of gas refunds on internal reverts is too unfair. Users pay for non-modification same cost as for modification.

## Specification

Let's consider all reverted SSTOREs as SLOADs (access) costs. This requires to remember (SSTORE - SLOAD) costs for each SSTORE inside every internal call excluding its subcalls and on revert let's update gas refund counter in the following manner:
```
tx.gas_refund_counter = tx.gas_refund_counter - call.gas_refund_counter + call.sstores_sloads_diff_counter;
```
