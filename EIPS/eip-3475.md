## Simple Summary

A standard interface for contract, that manage multiple callable bonds. A single contract includes any given number of bond classes, bond nonce, bond balance of an address. This standard provides independent functions to read, transfer any collection of bonds, as well as allow bonds to be redeemed from the bond issuer if certain conditions are met. This token standard can replace current ERC20 LP token. ERC-3475 has more complex data structure, which will allow the LP token to store more information, and allow the developer to build more sophisticated logic for the redemption and reward system of the DEFI project in question.

## Abstract

This API standard allows for the creation of any number of bonds type in a single contract. Existing LP token standards like ERC-20 require deployment of separate factory and token contracts per token type. The need of issuing bonds with multiple redemption data can’t be achieved with existing token standards. ERC-3475 Multiple Callable Bonds Standard allows for each bond class ID to represent a new configurable token type, and for each bond nonce to represent an issuing date or any other forms of data in uint256. Every single nonce of a bond class may have its own metadata, supply and other redemption conditions.

## Motivation

Current LP token is a simple ERC-20 token, which has not much complicity in data structure. To allow more complex reward and redemption logic to be built, we need a new LP token standard that can manage multiple bonds, stores much more data and gas efficient. ERC-3475 standard interface allows any tokens on solidity compatible block chains to create its own bond. These bonds with the same interface standard can be exchanged in secondary market. And it allows any 3rd party wallet applications or exchanges to read the balance and the redemption conditions of these tokens. ERC-3475 bonds can also be packed into separate packages. Those packages can in their turn be divided and exchanged in a secondary market.

New functions built in ERC-3475 Multiple Callable Bonds Standard, will allow the users to economize their gas fee spend. Trading and burning of ERC-3475 Bonds will also multiply tokens market cap, helping it to recover from recession period[(1)](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-future-of-algorithmic-stable-coin-13ddbc27485). Existing structures, such as AMM exchanges or lending platform can be updated to recognize ERC-3475 Bonds.

### Data structure

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.2;
import '@DeBond-Protocol/EIP-3475/blob/main/contracts/util/ERC3475data.sol';
```

`"_balances"`Is the array of bond class to a nonce, and to the balance. `mapping(address =>mapping(uint256=> uint256)) \_balances;` is the balance of an address are associated with the following 3d array: `B (a,c,n)`, where a is the vector of address, `c` is the vector of class and `n` is the vector of nonce.

e.g.

0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef =>(1 =>(5 => 500000000));
this example gives the balance of：
address 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef possess 500000000 of bond class 1, bond nonce 5.

```
mapping (address => mapping( uint256 =>mapping(uint256=> uint256))) private _balances;
```

`"_totalSupply"`Is the mapping from bond class and nonce to the total active supply.

***total supply = total supply +burned supply +redeemed supply.*

3D array of bond class => (bond nonce => bond total supply).

*e.g.*

*1 =>(5 => 25000000000); this example gives the total supply of： bond class 1, bond nonce 5 has a total supply of 25000000000 .*

```
mapping (uint256 => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) private _activeSupply;
```

"_activeSupply"`Is the mapping from bond class and nonce to the total active supply.

***Active supply = total supply - burned supply - redeemed supply.*

3D array of bond class => (bond nonce => bond active supply).

*e.g.*

*1 =>(5 => 25000000000); this example gives the total active supply of: bond class 1, bond nonce 5 has a total active supply of 25000000000 .*

```
mapping (uint256 => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) private _activeSupply;
```

`"_burnedSupply"`Is the mapping from bond class and nonce to the total burned supply.

***Burned supply = total supply - active supply - redeemed supply.*

3D array of bond class => (bond nonce => bond burned supply).

*e.g.*

*1 =>(5 => 0); this example gives the total burned supply of： bond class 1, bond nonce 5 has a total burned supply of 0 .*

```
mapping (uint256 =>  mapping(uint256 => uint256)) private _burnedSupply;
```

`"_redeemedSupply"`Is the mapping from bond class and nonce to the total active supply.

*** redeemed supply = total supply - active supply - burned supply.*

3D array of bond class => (bond nonce => bond redeemed supply).

*e.g.*

*1 =>(5 => 5000000000); this example gives the total redeemed supply of： bond class 1, bond nonce 5 has a total redeemed supply of 5000000000 .*

```
mapping (uint256 =>  mapping(uint256 => uint256)) private _redeemedSupply;
```

`"_nonceInfo" `is the mapping from a bond nonce to a list of uint256 variables, list of bond nonce to bond info. In this list, the 0th variable MUST be the starting time of the nonce in question. The 1st variable MUST be the maturity time of the nonce in question. Other variables can be described by`bondClass[class].nonceInfoDiscription[];` and defined by code.

e.g. `["1615584000","1616584000",(uint256)...]`

***this example gives the starting time of the bond nonce of the bond class, which is 1615584000; the maturity time, 1616584000...*

```
mapping ( uint256 =>mapping(uint256=> string[])) private _nonceInfo;
```

### EVENT

`"eventIssueBond"` MUST trigger when Bonds are issued. This SHOULD not include zero value Issuing. 

e.g. 

`"issue by address(operator) 500 DEBIT-USD Bond(Nonce14) to 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef"`

```
event eventIssueBond(address _operator, address _to, uint256 class, uint256 nonce, uint256 _amount); 
```

`"eventRedeemBond"` MUST trigger when Bonds are redeemed. This SHOULD not include zero value redemption. When burn a bond MUST not create this event(Use`"eventBurnBond" ` instead).

e.g. 

`"redeem by address(_operator) 500 DEBIT-USD Bond(Nonce14) to 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef"`

```
event eventRedeemBond(address _operator, address _from, uint256 class, uint256 nonce, uint256 _amount);
```

`"eventBurnBond"` MUST trigger when Bonds are burned. This SHOULD not include zero value burning. When redeem a bond MUST not create this event(Use`"event redeemBond" ` instead).

e.g. 

`"burn by address(_operator) 500 DEBIT-USD Bond(Nonce14) from 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef"`

```
event eventBurnBond(address _operator, address _from, uint256 class, uint256 nonce, uint256 _amount);
```

`"eventTransferBond"` MUST trigger when Bonds are transferred. This SHOULD not include zero value transfers. Transfer event with the `_from` `0x0` MUST not create this event(Use`"event issueBond" `instead ). Transfer event with the `_to` `0x0` MUST not create this event(Use`"event redeemBond" `when redemption, and `"event burnBond" `when burning).

e.g.

`"transfer by address(_operator) 500 DEBIT-USD Bond(Nonce14) from 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef, to address(_to)"`

```
event eventTransferBond(address _operator, address _from, address _to, uint256 class, uint256 nonce, uint256 _amount);
```

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-3475 contract is not Compatible with contracts that don't have an ERC-3475 interface built in. This requires the existing contract to upgrade with ERC-3475 interface. The receiving of ERC-3475 Bond need the implementation of ERC3475 interface in the receiver contract.

However any existing ERC-20 token contract can issue their ERC-3475 bond, by giving the minting role to a bonk contract with ERC-3475 interface built in. The implementation of This can be found in our Use Cases.

To ensure the reading of transactions, `"eventIssueBond"` ,`"eventRedeemBond"` ,`"eventBurnBond"` ,`"eventTransferBond"`, Events cited above MUST be emitted when such transaction is passed. 

***Note that the ERC 3475 interface is also compatible with ERC-20 and ERC-721 interface .*** But the creation of a separated bank contract is recommended for reading and future upgrade needs and .

The issuing of ERC-3475 bonds is not limited to ERC-20 token. Standard like ERC-721 nonfungible token can also issue their bond with the help of ERC-3475 interface. 

Any ERC3475 bond or any hybrid of ERC-20 and ERC-721 contract can be used as the collateral for another ERC-3475 bond. This allows the market to create bond represent no longer a single type of ERC-20 token. Bond can now represent a collection of collaterals in ERC-20 token, ERC-721 nonfungible token and ERC-3475 Multiple callable bonds...
