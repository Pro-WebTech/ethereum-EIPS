## Simple Summary

This is a standard for semi-fungible tokens. The set of smart contract interfaces described in this document defines an ERC-721 extension, by introducing an <ID, SLOT, AMOUNT> triple scalar model to represent the semi-fungible nature of a token. This standard also introduces an optional set of interfaces called 'UnderlyingContainer', for an ERC-3525 token to act as a representing layer of existing tokens, which is one of the key purpose of tokenization.

## Abstract

ERC-3525 is ERC-721 compatible, which means, as an ERC-721 token, each ERC-3525 token contains an ID property to identify itself as a universally unique entity. What empowers a ERC-3525 token is that it contains a 'units' property, representing the quantitative nature of the token. Thus, a ERC-3525 token can be split into several different ERC-3525 tokens, with certain properties maintained unchanged but the sum of the units of all split-out token equals that of the original one. Nevertheless, each ERC-3525 token has a 'SLOT' attribute, which labels its logical category. Several ERC-3525 tokens can be merged into one if their SLOT attributes indicate that they are of the same category.

## Motivation

Tokenization of assets is one of the most important applications in crypto. Normally there are two options when tokenizing assets: fungible and non-fungible. The first one generally uses the ERC-20 standard, in the case that every unit of assets is identical to each other, ERC-20 standard provides a flexible and efficient way to manipulate fungible tokens. The second one predominately uses the ERC-721 token standard, for that each asset needs to be described by one or more customized properties. For example, when a decentralized exchange that supports the Automatic Market-Making model allows its liquidity providers to specify their positions at different price ranges, an LP token can be implemented in ERC-721, since this token standard has the capability to identify each position as an entity, with different attributes for each entity.

Both options have significant drawbacks. In the fungible way, one needs to create a separate ERC-20 contract for each different value or combination of customizable properties, which can easily require an unacceptable number of ERC-20 contracts in practice. On the other hand, there is no quantitative feature in an ERC-721, hence significantly reducing the computability, liquidity, and manageability. For example, when we want to stake part of the position LP in some smart contract, the liquidity has to be withdrawn from the LP to create a new one, causes inconvenience and temporary decrease of liquidity.

An intuitive and direct way to solve the problem is to add a property to represent the quantitative nature directly to an ERC-721 token, making it best for both property customization and semi-fungibility. Furthermore, the ERC-721 compatibility would help the new standard easily utilize existing infrastructures and gain fast adoption.

### ERC-3525 Token Receiver

Smart contracts MUST implement all of the functions in the IERC3525Receiver interface to accept transfers. See “Safe Transfer Rules” for further detail. 

```javascript
 /**
        @notice Handle the receipt of a ERC-3525 token type.
        @dev A ERC-3525 compliant smart contract MUST call this function on the token recipient contract, at the end of a `safeTransferFrom` after the balance has been updated.        
        This function MUST return `bytes4(keccak256("onERC3525Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)"))` (i.e. 0xb382cdcd) if it accepts the transfer.
        This function MUST revert if it rejects the transfer.
        Return of any other value than the prescribed keccak256 generated value MUST result in the transaction being reverted by the caller.
        @param operator  The address which initiated the transfer (i.e. msg.sender)
        @param from      The address which previously owned the token
        @param id        The ID of the token being transferred
        @param units     The units of tokenId being transferred
        @param data      Additional data with no specified format
        @return           `bytes4(keccak256("onERC3525Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)"))`
	Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0xb382cdcd.
 */
interface IERC3525Receiver {
    function onERC3525Received(address operator, address from, uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 units, bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes4);
}
```


### Token Manipulation


#### Scenarios

**_Transfer:_**
	
An ERC-3525 token is ERC-721 compatible, it adds units transfer ability, that can transfer units from one token to another token.

The units level transfer has two types of interfaces, and both have safe and unsafe versions:

```solidity
	
1. function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 targetTokenId, uint256 units) external; 
   function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 targetTokenId, uint256 units, 
	    bytes calldata data) external; 

2. function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 units) external returns (uint256 newTokenId);
   function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 units, bytes calldata data) 
	    external returns (uint256 newTokenId);

```
The main difference between the two kinds of interface is whether the application or the contract is responsible for determining/generating the target token ID in the transfer.

Since transferring units of a token will possibly result in new token id creation, it's important to give the implementing contract the ability to do that. On the other hand, since part of a token can be transferred to a token with the same slot, we want to keep the flexibility for dapps to determine whether to use this ability, resulting in less contract complexity and less gas consumption.


**_Merge:_**

Several tokes with the same SLOT can be merged together using `merge(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, uint256 targetTokenId);`. `targetTokenId` should already exist, and cannot be one of `tokenIds`. After merging, `targetTokenId` owns all the units from the merged tokens, and the merged tokens will be burned.


**_Split:_**

One token can be split into several tokens, using`split(uint256 tokenId, uint256[] calldata units) returns (uint256[] memory newTokenIds);`. This will result in several newly generated tokens containing units equal to the parameter `units`.



#### Rules

**_approving rules:_**

- For being compatible with ERC721, there are three kinds of approving operations, which SHOULD be used to indicate different levels of approval.
- `setApprovalForAll` SHOULD indicate the top level of approval, the authorized operators are capable of handling all tokens, including their units, owned by the owner.
- The ID level `approve` SHOULD indicate that the `_tokenId` is approved to the operator, but not the units of that token.
- The units level `approve` with the `_units` parameter SHOULD indicate that only the specified amount of units are approved to the operator, but not the whole token.
- Any `approve` MUST revert if `msg.sender` is equal to `_to` or `_operator`.
- The units level `approve` MUST revert if `msg.sender` is not the owner of `_tokenId` nor set approval for all tokens.
- The units level `approve` MUST emit the `ApprovalUnits` event.

**_splitting rules:_**

- MUST revert if `_tokenId` is not a valid token.
- MUST revert if `msg.sender` is neither the owner of `_tokenId` nor set approval for all.
- MUST revert if the sum of all `_units` exceeds the actual amount of units in `_tokenId`.
- MUST return an array containing the ids of the generated tokens after splitting.
- MUST emit the `Split` event.

**_merging rules:_**

- MUST revert if `_targetTokenId` or any of `_tokenIds` is not a valid token.
- MUST revert if the owner of `tokenId` is not the owner of `_targetTokenId`.
- MUST revert if `msg.sender` is neither the owner of all `_tokenIds` and `targetTokenId` nor having been set approval for all.
- MUST revert if any of `_tokenIds` is equal to `_targetTokenId`.
- Each of `_tokenIds` MUST be burnt after being merged.
- MUST emit the `Merge` event.

**_transferFrom rules:_**

- The `transferFrom` without the `_targetTokenId` parameter SHOULD indicate transferring units to the recipient, whether the units are transferred into an existing token or a generated new token, should be decided by the implementation contract.
	- MUST revert unless `msg.sender` is the owner of `_tokenId`, or having been set approval for all tokens, or having been approved for a certain number units of `_tokenId`.	
	- MUST revert if `_tokenId` is not a valid token.
	- MUST revert if `_from` is not the current owner of `_tokenId`.
	- MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
	- MUST revert if the transfer amount exceeds the actual amount of units in `_tokenId`.
	- MUST revert if the transfer amount exceeds the approved units limit.
	- MUST return the newly created token of the recipient containing the transferred units.
	- MUST emit the `TransferUnits` event.
	
- The `transferFrom` with both the `_units` and the `_targetTokenId` parameters SHOULD indicate transferring units to an existing token of the recipient.
	- MUST revert unless `msg.sender` is the owner of `_tokenId`, or having been set approval for all tokens, or the transfer amount is within the ERC-3525 approved units limit.
	- MUST revert if either `_tokenId` or `_targetTokenId` is not a valid token.
	- MUST revert if `_from` is not the current owner of `_tokenId`.
	- MUST revert if `_to` is not the current owner of `_targetTokenId`.
	- MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
	- MUST revert if the transfer amount exceeds the actual amount of units in `_tokenId`.
	- MUST revert if the transfer amount exceeds the ERC-3525 approved units limit.
	- MUST emit the ERC-3525 level `TransferUnits` event.

**_safeTransferFrom rules:_**

- `safeTransferFrom` SHOULD be used to implement the same function as `transferFrom`, with an extra step to check if the recipient is capable of receiving ERC-3525 token units by implementing the `onERC3525Received` interface.
- MUST obey the above rules set for `transferFrom`.
- MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (code size > 0). If so, `safeTransferFrom` MUST call `onERC3525Received` on `_to` and MUST revert if the return value does not match `bytes4(keccak256("onERC3525Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)"))`




### Metadata 


#### Metadata Extensions

ERC-3525 metadata extensions are compatible ERC-721 metadata extensions.

The optional ERC3525Metadata extension can be identified with the ERC-165 Standard Interface Detection.

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.7.6;
interface ERC3525Metadata /* is IERC721Metadata */ {
    function contractURI() external view returns (string memory);
    function slotURI(uint256 slot_) external view returns (string memory);
}
```

### Approval

ERC-3525 adds a new approval model, that is, one can approve operators to transfer units from a token with certain ID, the new interface is:
```function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 units); ```



## Rationale 

### Metadata generation

Since ERC-3525 is designed for representing underlying assets, rather than artifacts for gaming or arts, the implementation should give out the metadata directly from contract code, rather than give a URL of a server for returning metadata.


### Design decision: Keep unsafe transfer

There are mainly two reasons we keep the unsafe transfer interfaces:

1. Since ERC-3525 token is ERC-721 compatible, we must keep compatibility for all wallets and contracts that are still calling unsafe transfer interfaces for ERC-721 tokens.
2. We want to keep the ability that dapps can trigger business logic on contracts by simply transferring ERC-3525 tokens to them, that is, a contract can put business logic in `onERC3525Received` function so that it can be called whenever a token is transferred using `safeTransferFrom`. However, in this situation, an approved contract with customized transfer functions like deposit etc. SHOULD never call `safeTransferFrom` since it will result in confusion that whether `onERC3525Received` is called by itself or other dapps that safe transfer a token to it.


### Approval

For maximum semantical compatibility with ERC-721, as well as simplifying the approval model, we decided to make the relationship between two levels of approval like that:

1. Approval of an id does not result in the ability to partial transfer units from this id by the approved operator;
2. Approval of all units in a token does not result in the ability to transfer the token entity by the approved operator;
3. `setApprovalForAll` will result in the ability to transfer any tokens from the owner, as well as the ability to partial transfer units from any token.
3. `setApprovalForAll` will result in the ability to approve any tokens of the owner to third parties, as well as the ability to approve partial transfer units of any token to third parties.


## Backwards Compatibility
	
As mentioned at the very beginning, a ERC-3525 is an extension interface of ERC721, hence it is 100% compatible with ERC-721.
