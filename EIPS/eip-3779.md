## Abstract

We define a safe EVM contract as one that cannot encounter an exceptional halting state.  In general, we cannot prove safety for Turing-complete programs. But we can prove a useful subset.

This EIP specifies validity rules that ensure that:
> Valid contracts will not halt with an exception unless they either
> * throw `out of gas` or
> * recursively overflow stack.

This EIP does not introduce any new opcodes.  Rather, it restricts the use of existing and proposed control-flow instructions.  The restrictions must be validated at contract initialization time – not at runtime – by the provided algorithm or its equivalent. This algorithm must take time and space near-linear in the size of the contract, so as not to be a denial of service vulnerability.

This specification is entirely semantic.  It imposes no further syntax on bytecode, as none is required to ensure the specified level of safety.  Ethereum Virtual Machine bytecode is just that -- a sequence of bytes that when executed causes a sequence of changes to the machine state.  The safety we seek here is simply to not, as it were, jam up the gears.

## Motivation

### Safety

For our purposes we define a safe EVM contract as one that cannot encounter an exceptional halting state.  From the standpoint of security it would be best if unsafe contracts were never placed on the blockchain.  Unsafe code can attempt to overflow stack, underflow stack, execute invalid instructions, and jump to invalid locations.

Unsafe contracts are exploits waiting to happen.

Validating contract safety requires traversing the contract code.  So in order to prevent denial of service attacks all jumps, including the existing `JUMP`, `JUMPI` and the other proposed jumps -- `RJUMP`, `RJUMPI`, `RJUMPV`, `RJUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB` -- must be validated at initialization time, and in time and space linear in the size of the code  

Dynamic jumps, where the destination of a `JUMP` or `JUMPI` is not known until runtime, are an obstacle to proving validity in linear time -- any jump can be to any destination in the code, potentially requiring time quadratic in the size of code. We use a linear-time, linear-space symbolic execution of the _code_ to treat some of the jumps as static, and the rest as invalid.

#### *Dynamic Jumps, Static Jumps, and Subroutines*

Dynamic jumps need not always impede control-flow analysis.  In the simplest and most common case
```
PUSH address
JUMP
```
is effectively a static jump.

Another important use of `JUMP` is to implement the return jump from a subroutine. So consider this example of calling and returning from a minimal subroutine:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    jumpdest
    push RTN_SQUARE 
    0x02
    push SQUARE
    jump
RTN_SQUARE
    jumpdest
    swap1
    jump

SQUARE:
    jumpdest
    dup1
    mul
    swap1
    jump
```
The return address -`RTN_SQUARE` - and the destination address - `SQUARE` - are pushed on the stack as constants and remain unchanged as they move on the stack, such that only those constants are passed to each `JUMP`. They are effectively static. *We do not need unconstrained dynamic jumps to implement subroutines.*

Even where jumps are dynamic it is possible to statically constrain their range by enumerating valid destinations in advance, as per the proposed `RJUMPV` instruction.

Finally, the static relative jumps of [EIP-4200](./eip-4200) and the simple subroutines of [EIP-2315](./eip-2315) provide static jumps directly. 

So we can validate the safety of contracts with a static analysis that takes time and space linear in the size of the *code*, as shown below.  And since we can, we should.

### Performance

Validating safe control flow at initialization time has  potential performance advantages.
* Static jumps do not need to be checked at runtime.
* Stack underflow does not need to be checked for at runtime.

## Specification

### Validity

> In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they're not. -- Albert Einstein

We define a _safe_ EVM contract as one that cannot encounter an exceptional halting state.  We validate _safety_ at initialization time to the extent practical.

#### *Exceptional Halting States*

The *execution* of each instruction is defined in the [Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) as a change to the EVM state that preserves the invariants of EVM state.  At runtime, if the execution of an instruction would violate an invariant the EVM is in an exceptional halting state.  The Yellow Paper defined five such states.
1. Insufficient gas
2. More than 1024 stack items
3. Insufficient stack items
4. Invalid jump destination
5. Invalid instruction

*A program is safe iff no execution can lead to an exceptional halting state.*

*We would like to consider EVM programs valid iff they are safe.*

*In practice*, we must be able to validate *code* in linear time to avoid denial of service attacks. And we must support dynamically-priced instructions, loops, and recursion, which can use arbitrary amounts of gas and stack. 

Thus our validation cannot consider concrete computations -- it only performs a limited symbolic execution of the _code_.  This means we will reject programs if we detect any invalid execution paths, even if those paths are not reachable at runtime.  And we will count as valid programs that do not in fact produce correct results.

We can detect only _non-recursive_ stack overflows at *validation time*, so we must check for the first two states at _runtime_:
* `out of gas` and
* stack overflow.

The remaining three states we can check at *validation time*:
* stack underflow,
* invalid jump, and
* invalid instruction.

That is to say:
> Valid contracts will not halt with an exception unless they either
> * throw `out of gas` or
> * recursively overflow stack.

#### *Constraints on Valid Code*

* Every instruction is valid.
* Every jump is valid:
   * Every`JUMP` and `JUMPI` is `static`.
   * No `JUMP`, `JUMPI`, `RJUMP`, `RJUMPI`, `RJUMPV`, or `RJUMPSUB` addresses immediate data.
* The stacks are always valid:
   * The _number_ of items on the `data stack` is always positive, and at most 1024.
   * The _number_ of items on the `return stack` is always positive, and at most 1024.
* The data stack is consistently available:
   * The `available items` on the `data stack` are always positive, and the same number of items are available for every _execution_ of a particular  _byte_code_.

We define a `JUMP` or `JUMPI` instruction to be `static` if its `jumpsrc` argument was first placed on the stack via a `PUSH…` and that value has not changed since, though it may have been copied via a `DUP…` or `SWAP…`.

The `RJUMP`, `RJUMPI` and `RJUMPSUB`instructions take a _jumpdst_ as an immediate argument, so they are `static`. The `RJUMPV` instructions take an index on the stack at runtime, and proceed via the `jumpdest` indexed in the jump vector, or else via its first, default `jumpdest`. In this way `RJUMPV` is constrained to be `static`, as the programmer must provide a default case, and all cases are validated.

The Yellow Paper has the `stack pointer` (`SP`) pointing just past the top item on the `data stack`.   We define the `available items` as the number of stack items between the current `SP` and the `SP` on entry to the most recent basic block.

Taken together, these rules allow for code to be validated by traversing the control-flow graph, in time and space linear in the size of the code, following each edge only once. 

## Rationale

Demanding static destinations for all jumps means that all jump destinations can be validated at initialization time, not runtime.

Bounding the stack pointers catches all `data stack` and non-recursive`return stack` overflows.

Requiring consistently available stack items prevents stack underflow. It can also catch such errors as misaligned stacks due to irreducible control flows, and calls to subroutines with the wrong number of arguments.

And relative rather than absolute jump destinations are consistent with the other `RJUMP` instructions, so that code remains position-independent.

_Note: The definition of `static` here is the bare minimum needed to implement subroutines.  Deeper analyses could be proposed that would validate a larger and probably more useful set of jumps, at the cost of more expensive (but still linear) validation._

_Note: Requiring the valid destinations of dynamic jumps to be enumerated at every jump instruction allows for tractable bytecode validation: a jump vector takes up space proportional to the number of destinations, so attempting to attack the validation algorithm with large numbers of jumps will also reduce the available space for jumps to be validated._

## Reference Implementation 

The following is a pseudo-Go implementation of an algorithm for predicating code validity.  An equivalent algorithm must be run at initialization time.  

This algorithm performs a symbolic execution of the program that recursively traverses the _code_, emulating its control flow and stack use and checking for violations of the rules above.

It runs in time equal to `O(vertices + edges)` in the program's control-flow graph, where edges represent control flow and the vertices represent _basic blocks_ -- thus the algorithm takes time proportional to the size of the _code_.

_Note: Because valid code has a control-flow graph that can be traversed in linear time there are other static analyses and code transformations that might otherwise require quadratic time can also be written to run in linear time, including those which must traverse or construct the control-flow graph._  

### Validation Function

For simplicity's sake we assume that _jumpdest analysis_ has been done and that we have a few helper functions.
* `is_valid_instruction(pc)` returns true if `pc` points at valid instruction
* `is_immediate_data(pc)` returns true if `pc` points at immediate data
* `immediate_data(pc)` returns the immediate data for an instruction.
* `advance_pc()` advances the pc,  skipping any immediate data.
* `removed_items(pc)`returns the number of items removed from the `data_stack` by an instruction.
* `added_items(pc)` returns the number of items added to the `data_stack` by an instruction.

## Backwards Compatibility

These changes affect the semantics of EVM code – the use of `JUMP`, `JUMPI`, and the stack are restricted, such that some *code* that would otherwise run correctly will nonetheless be invalid EVM *code*. 

## Security Considerations

This EIP is intended to ensure an essential level of safety for EVM code deployed on the blockchain.
