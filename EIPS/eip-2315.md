## Abstract

This proposal introduces two opcodes to support simple subroutines: `RJUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB`.

Taken together with other recent propoposals it provides an efficient, static, and safe control-flow facility.

## Motivation

The EVM does not provide subroutines as primitives.

Instead, calls can be synthesized by fetching and pushing the return address and subroutine address on the data stack and executing a `JUMP` to the subroutine; returns can be synthesized by getting the return address to the top of the stack and jumping back to it.  These conventions cost gas and use stack slots unnecessarily.  And they create unnecessary complexity that is borne by the humans and programs writing, reading, and analyzing EVM code.

*Note:  A stack-rolling operator to move the return address to the top of the stack and implicitly shift the intervening items could reduce the complexity of the code. But it would be an expensive operation with a dynamic gas cost.*

### Subroutines 

As an alternative, we propose to provide for subroutines with two simple operations:
* `RJUMPSUB` to call a subroutine and
* `RETURNSUB` to return from it.

Taken together with other recent propoposals they provide an _efficient, static, and safe_ control-flow facility.

*Efficient*.  Substantial reductions in the complexity and the gas costs of calling and optimizing simple subroutines -- as much as 56% savings in gas in the analysis below.  Substantial performance advantages for static jumps are [reported elsewhere](./eip-4200.md).

*Static*.  All possible jumps are known at contract creation time.

*Safe*.  Valid contracts will not halt with an exception unless they run out of gas or recursively overflow stack.

### History

Facilities to directly support subroutines are provided by all but one of the real and virtual machines we have programmed, including the Burroughs 5000, CDC 7600, IBM 360, DEC PDP 11 and VAX, Motorola 68000, Sun SPARC, a few generations of Intel silicon, ARM, UCSD p-machine, Sun JVM, Wasm, and the sole exception -- the EVM.  In whatever form, these operations provide for
* capturing the current context of execution,
* transferring control to a new context, and 
* returning to the original context
   * after possible further transfers of control
   * to some arbitrary depth.

The [concept](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/subroutines.html) goes back to [Turing's Automatic Computing Engine of 1946](http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/archive/p/p01/P01-001.html):
> ...
> We also wish to be able to arrange for the splitting up of operations into subsidiary operations.  This should be done in such a way that once we have written down how an operation is done we can use it as a subsidiary to any other operation.
> ...
> When we wish to start on a subsidiary operation we need only make a note of where we left off the major operation and then apply the first instruction of the subsidiary.  When the subsidiary is over we look up the note [on] a list of these notes in one or more standard size delay lines, (1024) with the most recent last...

Turing's machine held data in delay lines made of mercury-filled crystals.  We have better hardware now, but the concept is simple and by now familiar: Turing's "subsidiary operations" are subroutines, and his "list of notes" is a stack of return addresses. 

We propose to follow Turing's lead in the design of our subroutine facility, as specified below.

### Efficiency Analysis

We show here how these instructions can be used to reduce the complexity and gas costs of both ordinary subroutine calls and low-level optimizations compared to using `JUMP`.

We assume that `RJUMPSUB` costs 5 gas, and `RETURNSUB` costs 8 gas.  We justify these costs below, but they do not make a large difference in this analysis, as much of the improvement is due to `PUSH` and `SWAP` operations that are no longer needed.

#### **Simple Subroutine Call**

Consider this example of calling a fairly minimal subroutine.

Subroutine call, using `JUMP`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    RTN_SQUARE      ; 3 gas
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    SQUARE          ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas
RTN_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas

SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas
```
*Total: 50 gas*

Subroutine call, using `RJUMPSUB`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    jumpsub SQUARE  ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas

SQUARE:
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas
```
*Total 22 gas.*

Using `RJUMPSUB` saves $50-22=28$ gas over using `JUMP` -- a *56%* improvement.

#### **Tail Call Optimization**

Of course in cases like this one we can optimize the tail call, so that the return from `SQUARE` actually returns from `TEST_SQUARE`.

Tail call optimization, using `JUMP`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    SQUARE          ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas

SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas
```
*Total: 33 gas*

Tail call optimization, using `RJUMP` and `RETURNSUB`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    rjump SQUARE    ; 3 gas

SQUARE:
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas
```

*Total: 17 gas*

Using `RJUMPSUB` versus `JUMP` saves $33-17=16$ gas -- a *48%* improvement.

#### **Tail Call Elimination**

We can even take advantage of `SQUARE` just happening to directly follow `TEST_SQUARE` and just fall through rather than jump at all.

Tail call elimination, using JUMP:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    0x02            ; 3 gas

SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas
```

*Total: 24 gas*

Tail call `elimination`, using JUMPSUB:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    0x02            ; 3 gas

SQUARE:
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas
```

*Total 14 gas.*

Using `RETURNSUB` versus `JUMP` saves $24-14=10$ gas -- a *42%* improvement.

####  **Call Using Data Stack**

We can also consider an alternative call mechanism -- call it `JALTSUB` -- that pushes its return address on the `data_stack`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    jaltsub SQUARE  ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas

SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas
```
*Total 28 gas*, compared to *22 gas* for the `RJUMPSUB` version.  Possibly more, as using the wide-integer `data_stack` is probably less efficient than using a stack of native integers.

So we can see that these instructions provide a simpler and more gas-efficient subroutine mechanism than using `JUMP`.

_Note: Clearly, the benefits of these efficiencies are greater for programs that have been factored into smaller subroutines._

## Specification

To support calls and returns we specify an EVM `return stack` in addition to the existing `data stack`. The `return stack`, like the `data stack`, is limited to `1024` items. This stack supports two new instructions for subroutines.

### Instructions

#### `RJUMPSUB (0x5e) jmpdest`

> Transfers control to a subroutine.  The destination address is relative to current PC.  
>
> 1. Decode the `jmpdest` from the immediate data.  The data is encoded as two bytes, MSB-first.
> 2. Set `PC` to `PC + jmpdest`.
> 3. Push `PC + 1` on the `return stack`.
>
>  The cost is _low_.

#### `RETURNSUB (0x5f)`

> Returns control to the caller of a subroutine.
> 
> 1.  Pop `PC` off the `return stack`.
>
> The cost is _verylow_.

_Notes:_
* _If a resulting `PC` to be executed is beyond the last instruction then the opcode is implicitly a `STOP`, which is not an error._
* _Values popped off the `return stack` do not need to be validated, since they are alterable only by `RJUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB`._ 
* _The description above lays out the semantics of these instructions in terms of a `return stack`.  But the actual state of the `return stack` is not observable by EVM code or consensus-critical to the protocol.  (For example, a node implementer may code `RJUMPSUB` to unobservably push `PC` on the `return stack` rather than `PC + 1`, which is allowed so long as `RETURNSUB` observably returns control to the `PC + 1` location.)_
* _The `return stack` is the functional equivalent of Turing's "delay line"._

The _low_ cost of `RJUMPSUB` versus `JUMP` is justified by needing only to add the immediate two byte destination to the `PC` and push the return address on the `return stack`, all using native arithmetric, versus using the data stack with emulated 256-bit instructions.

The _verylow_ cost of `RETURNSUB` is justified by needing only to pop the `return stack` into the `PC`.  Benchmarking will be needed to tell if the costs are well-balanced.

### Safety

We define safety here as avoiding exceptional halting states, as defined in the Yellow Paper.  A validator can always detect three of these states at *validation time*:
* Insufficient stack items
* Invalid jump destination
* Invalid instruction

A validator can detect stack overflow only for non-recursive programs. So two states will still require tests at _runtime_:
* Stack overflow
* Insufficient gas 

[EIP-3779](./eip-3779.md) specifies creation-time validation to detect invalid contracts.

## Rationale

There are at least two designs for a subroutine facility.

**Turing's design** is to keep return addresses on a dedicated `return stack`.

The instruction to call a subroutine will
* push the return address onto the `return stack` and
* jump to the first instruction of the subroutine.

The instruction to return from a subroutine will
* jump to the address popped off of the`return stack`.

We have chosen Turing's design, as have Forth, the JVM, Wasm, and others

**An alternative design** is to keep return addresses on the `data stack`.

The instruction to call a subroutine will
* push the return address onto the `data stack` and
* jump to the first instruction of the subroutine.

The instruction to return from a subroutine will
* jump to the address popped off of the `data stack`.
_Note that the program must first ensure that the return address is the first element on the stack._

We give an example of the alternative design above.  Similar designs are used by the register machines we have programmed, where the stack is not usually used for computation. 

**We prefer** Turing's design for a few reasons.
* It maintains a clear separation between calculation and flow of control.  It's impossible to overwrite the return stack, and the data stack is uncluttered with vulnerable return addresses.
* It improves performance by
  * using native arithmetic rather than 256-bit EVM instructions for the return address,
  * not needing a `data stack` slot for the return address,
  * and not needing to rearrange arguments, return values, and the return address.
* It has a 75-year history of working well, including for the stack machines we have programmed.

## Backwards Compatibility

These changes affect the semantics of existing EVM code.  
These changes are compatible with [EIP-3779](./eip-3779.md).  Contracts satisfying the conditions given there will be valid.

## Security Considerations

These changes introduce new flow control instructions, so any software which does static/dynamic analysis of EVM code needs to be modified accordingly. The `RJUMPSUB` semantics are similar to `JUMP` whereas the `RETURNSUB` instruction is different, since it can 'land' on any opcode (but the possible destinations can be statically inferred).

## Test Cases

### Simple routine

This should jump into a subroutine, back out and stop.

Bytecode: `0x60045e005b5d` (`PUSH1 0x04, JUMPSUB, STOP, JUMPDEST, RETURNSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |    JUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    3  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |       [0] |
|    4  |       STOP  |    0 |        [] |        [] |

Output: 0x
Consumed gas: `10`

### Two levels of subroutines

This should execute fine, going into one two depths of subroutines

Bytecode: `0x6800000000000000000c5e005b60115e5d5b5d` (`PUSH9 0x00000000000000000c, JUMPSUB, STOP, JUMPDEST, PUSH1 0x11, JUMPSUB, RETURNSUB, JUMPDEST, RETURNSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |    JUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    3  |    JUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |       [0] |
|    4  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |     [0,3] |
|    5  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |       [3] |
|    6  |       STOP  |    0 |        [] |        [] |

Consumed gas: `20`

### Failure 1: invalid jump

This should fail, since the given location is outside of the code-range. The code is the same as previous example, 
except that the pushed location is `0x01000000000000000c` instead of `0x0c`.

Bytecode: (`PUSH9 0x01000000000000000c, JUMPSUB, `0x6801000000000000000c5e005b60115e5d5b5d`, STOP, JUMPDEST, PUSH1 0x11, JUMPSUB, RETURNSUB, JUMPDEST, RETURNSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |    JUMPSUB  |   10 |[18446744073709551628] |        [] |

```
Error: at pc=10, op=JUMPSUB: invalid jump destination
```

### Failure 2: shallow `return stack`

This should fail at first opcode, due to shallow `return_stack`

Bytecode: `0x5d5858` (`RETURNSUB, PC, PC`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |

```
Error: at pc=0, op=RETURNSUB: invalid retsub
```

### Subroutine at end of code

In this example. the JUMPSUB is on the last byte of code. When the subroutine returns, it should hit the 'virtual stop' _after_ the bytecode, and not exit with error

Bytecode: `0x6005565b5d5b60035e` (`PUSH1 0x05, JUMP, JUMPDEST, RETURNSUB, JUMPDEST, PUSH1 0x03, JUMPSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |      PUSH1  |    3 |        [] |        [] |
|    2  |       JUMP  |    8 |       [5] |        [] |
|    5  |   JUMPDEST  |    1 |        [] |        [] |
|    6  |    JUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    2  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |       [2] |
|    7  |       STOP  |    0 |        [] |        [] |

Consumed gas: `30`
