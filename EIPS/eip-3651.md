## Simple Summary
Starts the `COINBASE` address warm

## Abstract
The `COINBASE` address shall be warm at the start of transaction execution, in accordance with the actual cost of reading that account.

## Motivation
Direct `COINBASE` payments are becoming increasingly popular because they allow conditional payments, which provide benefits such as implicit cancellation of transactions that would revert.
But accessing `COINBASE` is overpriced; the address is initially cold under the access list framework introduced in [EIP-2929](./eip-2929).
This gas cost mismatch can incentivize alternative payments besides ETH, such as ERC20, but ETH should be the primary means of paying for transactions on Ethereum.

## Specification
At the start of transaction execution, `accessed_addresses` shall be initialized to also include the address returned by `COINBASE` (`0x41`).

## Rationale
The addresses currently initialized warm are the addresses that should already be loaded at the start of transaction validation.
The `ORIGIN` address is always loaded to check its balance against the gas limit and the gas price.
The `tx.to` address is always loaded to begin execution.
The `COINBASE` address should also be always be loaded because they receive the block reward as well as the transaction fees.
