## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokenized vaults with a single underlying [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) within smart contracts. This standard is an extension on the ERC-20 token that provides basic functionality for depositing and withdrawing tokens and reading balances.

## Motivation

Tokenized vaults have a lack of standardization leading to diverse implementation details. Some various examples include lending markets (Compound, Aave, Fuse), aggregators (Yearn, Rari Vaults, Idle), and intrinsically interest bearing tokens (xSushi). This makes integration difficult at the aggregator or plugin layer for protocols which need to conform to many standards. This forces each protocol to implement their own adapters which are error prone and waste development resources.

A standard for tokenized vaults will allow for a similar cambrian explosion to ERC-20, unlocking access to yield and other strategies in a variety of applications with little specialized effort from developers.


## Specification

All tokenized vaults MUST implement ERC-20. If a vault is to be non-transferrable, it MAY revert on calls to transfer or transferFrom. The ERC-20 operations balanceOf, transfer, totalSupply, etc. operate on the vault "shares" which represent ownership in the underlying.

### Methods

#### deposit

`function deposit(address to, uint256 value) public returns (uint256 shares)`

Mints `shares` amount of vault tokens to `to` by depositing `value` underlying tokens.

MUST support the ERC-20 transferFrom flow where the vault has at least `value` approval over msg.sender's balance of underlying.

MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the vault contract before the `deposit` execution, and are accounted for during `deposit`.

MUST emit the `Deposit` event.

#### mint

`function mint(address to, uint256 shares) public returns (uint256 value)`

Mints `shares` amount of vault tokens to `to` by depositing `value` underlying tokens.

MUST support the ERC-20 transferFrom flow where the vault has at least `value` approval over msg.sender's balance of underlying.

MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the vault contract before the `mint` execution, and are accounted for during `mint`.

MUST emit the `Deposit` event.

#### withdraw

`function withdraw(address from, address to, uint256 value) public returns (uint256 shares)`

Burns `shares` vault tokens from `from`, withdrawing `value` underlying tokens to `to`.

MUST support the ERC-20 flow in which the `from` address holds the `shares` vault tokens being burned. If `from != msg.sender`, then `msg.sender` MUST have ERC-20 approval over at least `shares` vault tokens from `from`.

MAY support an additional flow in which the vault tokens being burned are owned by the vault contract before the `withdraw` execution, instead of being owned by `from`.

MUST emit the `Withdraw` event.

#### redeem

`function redeem(address from, address to, uint256 shares) public returns (uint256 value)`

Burns `shares` vault tokens from `from`, withdrawing `value` underlying tokens to `to`.

MUST support the ERC-20 flow in which the `from` address holds the `shares` vault tokens being burned. If `from != msg.sender`, then `msg.sender` MUST have ERC-20 approval over at least `shares` vault tokens from `from`.

MAY support an additional flow in which the vault tokens being burned are owned by the vault contract before the `redeem` execution, instead of being owned by `from`.

MUST emit the `Withdraw` event.

#### totalUnderlying
`function totalUnderlying() public view returns (uint256)`

Returns the total amount of underlying tokens held/managed by the vault.

#### balanceOfUnderlying
`function balanceOfUnderlying(address owner) public view returns (uint256)`

Returns the total amount underlying tokens held in the vault for `owner`.

#### underlying
`function underlying() public view returns (address)`

Returns the address of the token the vault uses for accounting, depositing, and withdrawing. 

MUST return the address of a token implementing the ERC-20 standard.
    
#### calculateShares
`function calculateShares(uint256 underlyingAmount) public view returns (uint256 shareAmount)`

Returns the amount of vault shares corresponding to a given amount of underlying tokens. The return value of `calculateShares` MUST match the return value of a `withdraw` call executed immediately after in the same transaction.
    
#### calculateUnderlying
   
`function calculateUnderlying(uint256 shareAmount) public view returns (uint256 underlyingAmount)`;

Returns the amount of underlying tokens corresponding to a given amount of vault shares. The return value of `calculateUnderlying` MUST match the return value of a `mint` call executed immediately after in the same transaction.

### Events

#### Deposit

MUST be emitted when tokens are deposited into the vault.

`event Deposit(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)`

Where `from` is the user who triggered the deposit for `value` underlying tokens to the vault, and `to` is the user who is able to withdraw the deposited tokens. 


#### Withdraw

MUST be emitted when tokens are withdrawn from the vault by a depositor.

`event Withdraw(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)`

Where `from` is the owner who and held `value` underlying tokens in the vault, and `to` is the user who received the withdrawn tokens.


## Rationale

The vault interface is designed to be optimized for integrators with a feature complete yet minimal interface. Details such as accounting and allocation of deposited tokens are intentionally not specified, as vaults are expected to be treated as black boxes on-chain and inspected off-chain before use.

ERC-20 is forced because implementation details like token approval and balance calculation directly carry over to the shares accounting. This standardization makes the vaults immediately compatible with all ERC-20 use cases in addition to ERC-4626.

The vaults are opinionated on a default deposit/withdraw flow because it gives integrators a default pattern to implement. Special use cases can be overloaded on these functions by including additional logic.

The mint function was included for symmetry and feature completeness. Most current use cases of shares based vaults do not ascribe special meaning to the shares such that a user would optimize for a specific number of shares (mint) rather than specific amount of underlying (deposit). However, it is easy to imagine future vault strategies which would have unique and independently useful share representations.

The `calculateShares` method cannot be guaranteed to be simultaneously exact with the return values for both `deposit` and `withdraw`. It matches the return value of `withdraw` to allow querying the vault for the exact amount of underlying that should be approved for transfer in a `withdraw` call for the current transaction. The inclusion of a `calculateSharesOnDeposit` function was considered unnecessary.

The `calculateUnderlying` method cannot be guaranteed to be simultaneously exact with the return values for both `mint` and `redeem`. It matches the return value of `mint` to allow querying the vault for the exact amount of shares that should be taken from the caller in a `mint` call for the current transaction. The inclusion of a `calculateUnderlyingOnRedeem` function was considered unnecessary.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-4626 is fully backward compatible with the ERC-20 standard and has no known compatibility issues with other standards. For production implementations of vaults which do not use ERC-4626, wrapper adapters can be developed and used.

## Reference Implementation

[Solmate Minimal Implementation](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/pull/88) - a tokenized vault using the ERC-20 extension with hooks for developers to add logic in deposit and withdraw.

[Rari Vaults](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/vaults/blob/main/src/Vault.sol) are an implementation that is nearly ready for production release. Any discrepancies between the vaults abi and this ERC will be adapted to conform to the ERC before mainnet deployment.

## Security Considerations

This specification has similar security considerations to the ERC-20 interface. Fully permissionless yield aggregators, for example, could fall prey to malicious implementations which only conform to the interface but not the specification.
